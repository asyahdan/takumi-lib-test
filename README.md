Project yang akan dibuat kali ini adalah game Shoot em up seperti touhou

Konsep game :
1. Shoot em up game
theres thing called border in touhou but it appears that i found a way to make the touhou gameplay unique

lets say theres a character who can possibly extend the boundary of touhou i refer to that square thingy that limits you to move in touhou this might be a crazy idea once i have the demo, this idea kinda inspired from geometry dash's free ship move

so lets say you want to escape some kinda bullet but your movement are limited on a square... well say no more the square movement now will get scaled into full screen and you can escape from the bullet with free camera movement!
a reminder its just a sample please dont tell if its gonna ruin the game cuz its my own game
creating 3D env background is really pain
i want to post the demo game but its still on .sln file which takes time to load and my laptop are surely will teared apart
